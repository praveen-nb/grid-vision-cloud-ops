# Zero Trust Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) implementation for our AWS-based utility grid management system. The implementation follows NIST SP 800-207 guidelines and provides defense-in-depth security for critical infrastructure operations.

## Zero Trust Principles Implemented

### 1. Never Trust, Always Verify
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: All user access requires MFA
- **Device Verification**: All devices must be registered and verified
- **Session Validation**: Continuous session monitoring and validation
- **Certificate-based Authentication**: mTLS for service-to-service communication

### 2. Least Privilege Access
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary elevated permissions
- **Resource-level Permissions**: Fine-grained access to specific resources
- **Network Microsegmentation**: Isolated network zones

### 3. Assume Breach
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Anomaly detection for user and system behavior
- **Incident Response**: Automated containment and remediation
- **Forensic Capabilities**: Comprehensive audit trails
