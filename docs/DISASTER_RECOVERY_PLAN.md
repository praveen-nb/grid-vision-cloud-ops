# Disaster Recovery Plan
## AWS GIS Infrastructure - NERC CIP-009 Compliant

### Executive Summary

This Disaster Recovery Plan establishes comprehensive recovery procedures for the AWS-based GIS Infrastructure system, ensuring business continuity for critical utility operations while maintaining full NERC CIP compliance.

### 1. Recovery Objectives

#### Critical Systems RTO/RPO Targets
- **SCADA Control Systems**: RTO < 15 minutes, RPO < 1 minute
- **Real-time Analytics**: RTO < 30 minutes, RPO < 5 minutes
- **GIS Applications**: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour
- **Customer Portal**: RTO < 8 hours, RPO < 4 hours

### 2. Infrastructure Architecture

#### Primary Site (us-east-1)
- **EC2 Instances**: Auto Scaling Groups with Multi-AZ deployment
- **RDS Database**: Multi-AZ with automated backups (7-day retention)
- **S3 Storage**: Cross-Region Replication to us-west-2
- **Lambda Functions**: Deployed across multiple AZs
- **VPC**: Redundant subnets across 3 availability zones

#### Secondary Site (us-west-2)
- **Warm Standby**: Pre-configured EC2 instances (stopped)
- **RDS Read Replica**: Promoted to primary during failover
- **S3 Bucket**: Cross-region replicated data
- **Route 53**: Health checks with automatic DNS failover

#### Tertiary Backup (Azure Central US)
- **Cold Storage**: Critical data archived in Azure Blob Storage
- **VM Images**: System snapshots for extended outage scenarios

### 3. Data Protection Strategy

#### Backup Schedule
- **Real-time**: Continuous RDS transaction log backups
- **Hourly**: Application data snapshots to S3
- **Daily**: Full system backups to secondary region
- **Weekly**: Cross-cloud backup to Azure
- **Monthly**: Long-term archival to Glacier

#### Data Classification
- **Tier 1 (Critical)**: SCADA data, control commands
- **Tier 2 (Important)**: GIS data, customer information
- **Tier 3 (Standard)**: Reports, logs, analytics

### 4. Disaster Scenarios & Response

#### Scenario 1: Single AZ Failure
- **Detection**: CloudWatch alarms within 2 minutes
- **Response**: Auto Scaling redistributes load to healthy AZs
- **RTO**: < 5 minutes (automated)
- **Impact**: No service interruption

#### Scenario 2: Regional Outage
- **Detection**: Route 53 health checks fail
- **Response**: DNS failover to us-west-2
- **Manual Steps**: Promote RDS read replica, start warm standby instances
- **RTO**: < 30 minutes
- **Impact**: Brief service interruption

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Region AWS Outage
- **Detection**: Manual assessment required
- **Response**: Activate Azure emergency procedures
- **Manual Steps**: Deploy VMs from snapshots, restore from Blob Storage
- **RTO**: < 4 hours
- **Impact**: Extended outage with limited functionality

### 5. Recovery Procedures

#### Automated Recovery (Tier 1)
1. CloudWatch triggers Lambda function
2. Route 53 performs DNS failover
3. Auto Scaling launches replacement instances
4. Application Load Balancer reroutes traffic
5. Notification sent to on-call team

#### Manual Recovery (Tier 2)
1. Incident commander activates DR team
2. Assess scope and impact of outage
3. Execute region failover procedures
4. Promote read replicas to primary
5. Update DNS records manually if needed
6. Validate system functionality
7. Communicate status to stakeholders

#### Emergency Recovery (Tier 3)
1. Activate emergency operations center
2. Deploy Azure infrastructure
3. Restore data from cross-cloud backups
4. Configure temporary network connectivity
5. Implement manual workarounds
6. Plan extended recovery timeline

### 6. Communication Plan

#### Notification Matrix
- **Executive Team**: Within 15 minutes
- **Operations Staff**: Within 5 minutes
- **Customers**: Within 30 minutes (if customer-facing)
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Within 1 hour (if required)

#### Communication Channels
- **Primary**: AWS SNS + PagerDuty
- **Secondary**: Microsoft Teams
- **Backup**: Phone tree system

### 7. Testing & Validation

#### Monthly Tests
- Backup verification and restore testing
- CloudWatch alarm validation
- Contact list updates

#### Quarterly Tests
- Simulated AZ failure using AWS Fault Injection Simulator
- RDS failover testing
- Cross-region communication testing

#### Annual Tests
- Full DR scenario simulation
- Azure emergency procedures
- NERC CIP compliance audit

### 8. NERC CIP Compliance

#### CIP-009 Requirements Addressed
- **Recovery plans**: Documented for all BES Cyber Systems
- **Testing**: Quarterly testing with documented results
- **Training**: Annual DR training for all personnel
- **Coordination**: Emergency response coordination procedures

#### Documentation Requirements
- All DR activities logged in AWS CloudTrail
- Test results stored in S3 with encryption
- Annual compliance reports generated automatically

### 9. Maintenance & Updates

#### Regular Activities
- **Weekly**: Review backup success rates
- **Monthly**: Update recovery procedures
- **Quarterly**: DR plan review and testing
- **Annually**: Complete plan revision

#### Change Management
- All infrastructure changes require DR impact assessment
- DR plan updates trigger notification to stakeholders
- Version control maintained in Git with approval workflow

### 10. Emergency Contacts

#### 24/7 On-Call Rotation
- **Primary**: Infrastructure Team Lead
- **Secondary**: Cloud Operations Manager
- **Escalation**: VP Engineering

#### External Contacts
- **AWS Support**: Enterprise 24/7 support
- **Azure Support**: Premier support contact
- **NERC Compliance**: Regulatory affairs team
