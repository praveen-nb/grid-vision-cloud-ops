# Zero Trust Architecture Implementation

## Quick Start Guide

This repository implements a comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for AWS-based utility grid management systems, following NIST SP 800-207 guidelines.

## 🔒 What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security paradigm that assumes no trust by default. Every user, device, and network flow is verified before granting access to systems and data.

### Core Principles
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Verify every user and device
- **Least Privilege Access**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Assume Breach**: Design for when (not if) breaches occur

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

## 🛠️ Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Domain name for SSL certificates (optional)

### 1. Clone and Configure
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd aws-utility-infrastructure
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars
```

### 2. Update Configuration
Edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`:
```hcl
# Basic Configuration
project_name = "your-utility-system"
environment  = "prod"
aws_region   = "us-east-1"

# Zero Trust Configuration
enable_bastion = false                    # No direct SSH access
admin_cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.0/24"]  # Your admin network
enable_waf = true                        # Enable WAF protection

# PrivateLink Configuration
partner_services = [
  {
    service_name = "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-example"
    resource_arn = "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:123456789012:api/*"
  }
]
```

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check VPC endpoints
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints --region us-east-1

# Verify security groups
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region us-east-1

# Test CloudFront distribution

# Enable bastion host for emergency access
enable_bastion = true
admin_cidr_blocks = ["your-office-ip/32"]

# Configure partner services
partner_services = [
